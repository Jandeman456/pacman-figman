Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
    return {
        "getNewCoord"    : getNewCoord,
        "isVunerable"    : isVunerable,
        "isDangerous"    : isDangerous,
        "isHidden"       : isHidden,
        "getColour"      : getColour,
        "draw"           : draw,
        "drawBlock"      : drawBlock,
        "eat"            : eat,
        "reset"          : reset,
        "move"           : move,
        "position"       : position,
        "makeEatable"    : makeEatable
    };
}; // Close Pacman.Ghost

```

I've added the missing closing brackets and braces to properly close the Pacman.Ghost function and its return object. The rest of the code appears to be properly closed.

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional files that need fixing!
